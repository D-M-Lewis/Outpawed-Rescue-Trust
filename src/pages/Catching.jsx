                    <h3 className='text-3xl text-purpl mt-4'>Before Trapping:</h3>
                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>
                        Choose a suitable day and time: Ideally, trap the cat around its regular feeding time in the evening. If the cat isn't regularly fed, ask the property owner to provide food at the same time each evening for a week before trapping. Remember not to feed the cat on the day of trapping.</p>

                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>Assess the area: Determine the best spot to set the trap. The feeding area is a good starting point, but also have a backup location that offers shelter in case of bad weather.</p>

                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>Notify neighbors: If possible, inform your neighbors about the trapping process and ask them to keep their pets indoors during this time.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl text-purple mt-4'>During Trapping:</h3>

                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>Choose the right bait: Use strong-smelling wet food like tuna, salmon, or sardines as bait in the trap.</p>

                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>Minimize stress: Trapping can be stressful for the cat, so follow these steps to minimize stress:</p>

                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>Check the trap frequently, at least once every hour.
                        Do not leave the trap unattended for an extended period. If you need to leave, unset the trap until you return.
                        After trapping a cat, cover the trap with a blanket or towel.
                        Do not keep the cat in the trap for more than six hours.
                        Avoid trapping domestic pets: In urban areas, there is a risk of trapping someone's pet cat. If you accidentally trap a domestic pet, make sure it's unharmed and release it immediately. Remember, trapping should only take place on private property, and if you're not the property owner, obtain consent before trapping.</p>

                    <h3 className='text-3xl text-purple mt-4'>Dealing with Trap-Shy Cats:</h3>

                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>Try different techniques if the cat is difficult to trap:</p>

                    <p className='py-4 text-purple'>Cover the trap with a blanket or towel.
                        Place cardboard or a cloth on the floor of the trap.
                        Consider using a two-door tunnel trap instead of the regular trap.
                        Change the type of food used as bait.
                        If the cat still refuses to enter the trap, leave the trap unset in the feeding area for several days to familiarize the cat with it. Keep the trap's door propped open with an object and place food just inside the trap. Gradually move the food bowl further to the back of the trap until the cat feels comfortable eating inside it. Once the cat is familiar with the trap, set it and attempt to catch the cat again.</p>

                        <li className='px-8 list-disc'>If you're not personally responsible for getting the cat spayed/neutered and returned to its territory, be ready to transport it immediately to the nearest appropriate rescue organization. Make arrangements with the relevant organization in advance.</li>
                        <li className='px-8 list-disc'> If you cannot transport the cat immediately, keep it in a safe and isolated room or suitable holding crate until transport can be arranged. We may be able to assist with transport in some cases.</li>
                        <li className='px-8 list-disc'> The cat should not be left in the trap for more than six hours.</li>

                        <li className='px-8 list-disc'>In densely populated areas, there is a high risk of trapping a companion/owned cat. If this happens, ensure the cat is unharmed and release it immediately. Trapping should only occur on private property, and if you're not the property owner, obtain consent from the owner/resident. You may be held liable for any injury caused to an owned animal.</li>

                        <li className='px-8 list-disc'>Return the trap to our registered address within five days of receiving it, unless other arrangements have been made for an extended loan period. Do not use our trap to trap and euthanize or harm healthy cats. The trap should not be left unattended while set.</li>

                        <li className='px-8 list-disc'>This service is free, but we require a $50 bond when you collect the trap. The bond will be refunded upon the trap's return in good condition and by the agreed time. You are responsible for the replacement cost if the trap is lost, stolen, or damaged while on loan. If the cat is taken into the care of The Outpawed Rescue Trust, we will make all decisions regarding the cat's care, health, and welfare.</li>

                        <li className='px-8 list-disc'>Please provide all relevant information about the cats you intend to trap. Record the address where trapping will occur on the trap loan request form. The trap should only be used at this address unless prior off-site arrangements have been made.</li>
